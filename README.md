# Web Audio Api implementation for Node.js

Yet another Web Audio Api.


## Install

```
npm i -s waa-raub
```

Note: as this is a compiled addon, compilation tools must be in place on your system.
Such as MSVS13 for Windows, where **ADMIN PRIVELEGED**
`npm i -g windows-build-tools` most probably helps.
